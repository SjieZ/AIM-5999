I tried to pass 10x6 dimension, in hope it would work, but it just throw up the error.?","That is a very nonstandard variation of k-means. So you cannot expect sklearn to be prepared for every exotic variation. That would make sklearn slower for everybody else.
In fact, your approach is more like certain regression approaches (predicting the last value of the cluster centers) rather than clustering. I also doubt the results will be much better than simply setting the last value to the average of all points assigned to the cluster center using the other 6 dimensions only. Try partitioning your data based on the nearest center (ignoring the last column) and then setting the last column to be the arithmetic mean of the assigned data.
However, sklearn is open source.
So get the source code, and modify k-means. Initialize the last component randomly, and while running k-means only update the last column. It's easy to modify it this way - but it's very hard to design an efficient API to allow such customizations through trivial parameters - use the source code to customize at his level.</s>"

My next question is, if it IS correct, are there ways to reduce memory requirements to a more realistic level while still keeping the matrix the same size?

Anthony?","In theory, an element of {0, 1} should consume at most 1 bit per cell.

You said that in many cases you won't even need matrix so large. So, you can create smaller matrix at start (10,000 x 10,000) and then double the size every time enlargment is needed, copying old contents.
If your matrix is sparse (has much much more 1's than 0's or vice-versa), then it is much more efficient to store just coordinates where ones are in some efficient data structure, depending what operations (search, data access) you need.

Then break your list in equal chunks, I mean list of list [[id1, id2, id3], [id4, id5, id6] ... ] and do a for loop for sub-list in list: db.xyz.find({'key':{'$in': sublist}}, {'_id': 1}) and use the sub list as parameter in $in operator. Then for each iteration if the value exist in the db it will return the _id and we can easily store that in a empty list and append it and we will be able to get all the id's in such cases where the value exist in the collection.
So it's just the way I would do. Not necessarily the best possible.</s>"

What is the reason behind this behavior of igraph? When should and when should I not use the pickle format? 
Please shed light into this.?","Pickling is a generic format to store arbitrary objects, which may reference other objects, which may in turn also reference other objects. Therefore, when Python is pickling an object, it must keep track of all the objects that it has ""seen"" and serialized previously to avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop. That's probably the reason why pickling is slower (and uses more memory).
The advantage of using pickling is that the pickled representation will preserve the exact Python type of every single graph, vertex or edge attribute (provided that you use types that support pickling). GraphML won't keep the exact types because there is no unambiguous mapping from Python types to GraphML types; for instance, all numeric attributes would be converted to doubles in the GraphML representation, irrespectively of whether the original attributes were Python ints, longs, or floating-point numbers.</s>"

For example, if one of the reducer outputs should go straight back to the datastore, and another output should go to a file, you could open a file yourself and write the outputs to it. Alternatively, you could serialize and explicitly store the intermediate map results to a temporary datastore using operation.db.Put, and perform separate Map or Reduce jobs on that datastore. Of course, that will end up being more expensive than the first workaround.
In your specific key-value example, I'd suggest writing to a Google Cloud Storage File, and postprocessing it to split it into three files as required. That'll also give you more control over final file names.</s>"

There is any magic number as a multiplier for n-gram frequency in order to be comparable with a unigram? 
A solution that I have now in mind is to make a top for any n-gram (1, 2, 3, ...) and use the first z positions for any category of n-grams.?","As you've asked this, there is no simple linear multiplier.  You can make a general estimate by the size of your set of units.  Consider the English alphabet of 26 letters: you have 26 possible unigrams, 26^2 digrams, 26^3 trigrams, ... Simple treatment suggests that you would multiply a digram's frequency by 26 to compare it with unigrams; trigram frequencies would get a 26^2 boost.
I don't know whether that achieves the comparison you want, as the actual distribution of n-grams is not according to any mathematically tractable function.  For instance, letter-trigram distribution is a good way to differentiate the language in use: English, French, Spanish, German, Romanian, etc. have readily differential distributions.
Another possibility is to normalize the data: convert each value into a z-score, the amount of standard deviations above/below the mean of the distribution.  The resulting list of z-scores has a mean of 0 and a standev of 1.0

This is in contrast to static data structures, which have a fixed size that is determined when the program is compiled. Dynamic data structures are often implemented using pointers, which allow them to allocate and deallocate memory as needed. Some common dynamic data structures include linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. Dynamic data structures are useful because they can adapt to changing data needs and do not require the programmer to know the size of the data in advance. However, they can be more complex to implement and may have slower performance than static data structures in some cases.</s>"

Does the app have to reload/parse all of this data every time a client logs onto the website? Or does the dash server load all the data only the first time it is instantiated and then just dish it out every time a client logs on?
If the data reloads every time, I would then use quick parsers like udatetime, but if not, id prefer to use a convenient parser like pendulum which isn't as efficient (but wouldn't matter if it only parses once).

"I am well known with that a “normal” neural network should use normalized input data so one variable does not have a bigger influence on the weights in the NN than others.
But what if you have a Qnetwork where your training data and test data can differ a lot and can change over time in a continous problem?
My idea was to just run a normal run without normalization of input data and then see the variance and mean from the input datas of the run and then use the variance and mean to normalize my input data of my next run.
But what is the standard to do in this case?
Best regards Søren Koch?","Normalizing the input can lead to faster convergence. It is highly recommended to normalize the inputs. 
And as the network will progress through different layers due to use of non-linearities the data flowing between the different layers will not be normalized anymore and therefore, for faster convergence we often use batch normalization layers. Unit Gaussian data always helps in faster convergence and therefore make sure to keep it in unit Gaussian form as much as possible.</s>"

This is a huge field but I`ll try to write a few important notes:

Try to generate a dataframe where each row is a timestamp and each column is a feature. 
Now you can generate rolling features - for example rolling mean/std of your features, using a few different time windows.
split your data to train and test - this is a very tricky part in time series data. You should be very careful with this. You have to split the data by time (not randomly), in order to simulate the real world where you learn from the past and predict the future. You must verify that you haven't a leakage - for example, if you use as a feature ""rolling mean of the last week"", you must verify that you didn't calculated your signal for validation using data from the train set.

Putting examples in a batch along the rows of a matrix (i.e., the first axis of the input tensor) is the prevailing way of training deep learning models. Virtually any tensorflow2 / keras example you can find follows that pattern. Putting them along any non-first axis is much rarer.

As said, the row dimension is the preferred way of storing samples. I can think of two reasons why this is the case,

TF does a lot of matrix multiplications involving batches of data. Therefore, by keeping batch dimension as the first dimension, you are able to continuously produce tensors using matrix multiplication, which also has the batch dimension as the first dimension. (e.g. [batch size, 10] . [10, 2] produces [batch size, 2])
The other reason is that the row dimension is the slowest changing dimension. Therefore by you can access an individual sample by taking a single contiguous chunk of memory which is always preferred when it comes to disk reading/ memory reading.</s>"

"I am just curious on the interpretation of sklearn's feature_importances_ attribute. I know that the features with highests coefficients are the features that would highly predict the outcome. My question is - Are these the features strongly predictive to return a 1 (or yes) or not necessarily? (Supervised Learning - Binary response - yes(1) or no(0)).
For example, after building the predictive model, I found out that these words are the top features - insider-trading, theft, embezzlement, investment. The response is 'illegal'(1) or 'legal'(0).
Does it mean that when a certain text has those words, there's a huge chance it's illegal or not necessarily? And, it just simply means that the value of these words would lead to a strong prediction (either illegal or legal). Appreciate any answer to such.?","It means those words are ""strongly associated"" with one of the responses, in your case probably illegal(1). Depending on your classifier, the exact technical definition of strongly associated will vary. It could be the joint probability of the word and response, P(X='theft', Y='illegal'), or it could be the conditional probabilityP(X='theft' | Y='illegal').
Intuitively, whenever these terms appear in a document, the probability of that document belonging to the illegal category is increased.</s>"

If I have two or more GPUs, is there a way that I can train model0 on data0 on GPU0 and model1 on data1 on GPU1 in parallel? All of the methods I have found so far split the training of a single model over multiple gpus.
Thanks!?","How about multiprocessing?
You just execute you function in a multiprocessing pool twice:
What you need to consider:

Your model have to be defined or loaded inside the function
You need a parameter which mask the GPUs. Masking is possible by setting the env variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES(you also have to do this inside the function)
You could pass the different training data via a parameter
it would be best to save the resulting models into different files and then load it from your main program 

So basically passing keras/tensorflow sessions between your main programm and the functions in the multiprocessing tool is a nogo. But if you keep everything keras/tensorflow related inside the function and mask the GPUs differently then you're good to go.</s>"

I note that a 2D array in most language implementations (anything in which that is implemented as ""array of array of X"" suffers from additional access time overhead (one access to the top level array, a second to the subarray).
I suggest you implement the data structure abstractly as a 2D array (perhaps even continuing to use 2 indexes), but implement the array as single block of 81 cells, indexed classically by i*9+j. This gives you conceptual clarity, and somewhat more efficient implementation, by avoiding that second memory access.
You should be able to hide the 1D array access behind setters and getters that take 2D indexes.  If your language has the capability (dunno if this is true for Python), such small methods can be inlined for additional speed.</s>"

Is there something wrong or it is normal because it's a gan?
Thank you in advance.?","In order to fully answer this question (specific to your case) we'd need to know what loss function you are using and how you measure accuracy.
In general, this can certainly happen for a variety of reasons.  The easiest reason to illustrate is with a simple classifier.  Suppose you have a 2-class classification problem (for simplicity) and an input $x$ and label (1, 0), i.e. the label says it belongs to class 1 and not class 2.  When you feed $x$ through your network you get an output: $y=(p_1, p_2)$.  If $p_1 > p_2$ then the prediction is correct (i.e. you chose the right class).  The loss function can continue to go down until $p_1=1$ and $p_2=0$ (the target).  So, you can have lots of correct predictions (high accuracy) but still have room to improve the output to better match the labels (room for improved loss).</s>"

"Background:
My program currently assembles arrays in Python. These arrays are connected to a front-end UI and as such have interactive elements (i.e. user specified values in array elements). These arrays are then saved to .txt files (depending on their later use). The user must then leave the Python program and run a separate Fortran script which simulates a system based on the Python output files. While this only takes a couple of minutes at most, I would ideally like to automate the process without having to leave my Python UI. 

Assemble Arrays (Python) -> Edit Arrays (Python) -> Export to File (Python)
-> Import File (Fortran) -> Run Simulation (Fortran) -> Export Results to File (Fortran)
-> Import File to UI, Display Graph (Python)

Edit:
I should also mention that the fortran script uses Lapack, I don't know if that makes a difference.?","I love the Python+Fortran stack. :)
When needing close communication between your Python front-end and Fortran engine, a good option is to use the subprocess module in Python. Instead of saving the arrays to a text file, you'll keep them as arrays. Then you'll execute the Fortran engine as a subprocess within the Python script. You'll pipe the Python arrays into the Fortran engine and then pipe the results out to display.
This solution will require changing the file I/O in both the Python and Fortran codes to writing and reading to/from a pipe (on the Python side) and from/to standard input and output (on the Fortran side), but in practice this isn't too much work.

"So I've recently started looking into network flows (Max flow, min cuts, etc) and the general problems for network flow always involve assigning ""n"" of something to ""k"" of another thing. For example, how would I set up a network flow for ""n"" children in a city that has ""k"" schools such that the children's homes are within x kilometres of the school (for simplicity, let's just say 1km)? 
What if I were to further add limitations, for example, say each school cannot have more than 100 students? Or 300 students? Could someone help me with how I would initially set up my algorithm to approach problems like these (would appreciate any references too)? They tend to show up on past midterms/exams, so I just wanted to be prepared?","Create vertices for each student and each school. Draw an edge with capacity 1 from each student to each school that they can attend according to your distance constraint. Create a source vertex with edges to each student with a capacity of 1. Create a sink vertex with edges coming in from each school with capacities equal to each school's maximum capacity.
Running a standard max-flow algorithm will match as many students as possible to schools. Not every student is guaranteed to get to go to school, of course, given the constraints.
This is basically a modification of the standard maximum bipartite matching algorithm. The main difference is that the sinks have capacities greater than 1, which allows multiple students to be matched to a school.</s>"

Explain Mealy and Moore Machines in computer hardware.?,"By ""normalize"" do you just mean making everything lowercase?  
The decision about whether to lowercase everything is really dependent of what you plan to do.  For some purposes, lowercasing everything is better because it lowers the sparsity of the data (uppercase words are rarer and might confuse the system unless you have a massive corpus such that the statistics on capitalized words are decent).  In other tasks, case information might be valuable.
Additionally, there are other considerations you'll have to make that are similar.  For example, should ""can't"" be treated as [""can't""], [""can"", ""'t""], or [""ca"", ""n't""] (I've seen all three in different corpora).  What about 7-year-old?  Is it one long word?

If either gradient is not zero, you are not at a minimum, and you would descend further.
As a further point, you could well be interested in the curvature, or second derivative, because high curvature means a narrow (precise) minimum, while low curvature means a nearly flat minimum, with very uncertain estimates.

Thanks a lot?","There are several reasons for a NaN loss and why models diverge. Most common ones I've seen are:

Your learning rate is too high. If this is the case, the loss increases and then diverges to infinity.
You are getting a division by zero error. If this is the case, you can add a small number like 1e-8 to your output probability.
You have bad inputs. If this is the case, make sure that you do not feed your model with NaNs. i.e. use assert not np.any(np.isnan(x)) on the input data.
Your labels are not in the same domain of your objective function. If this is the case, check the range of your labels and make sure they match.

If none of the above helps, try to check the activation function, the optimizer, the loss function, the size and the shape of the network.

The (high level part of the) OS sees more memory than actually present, and pages are copied on disk. When one is needed another one is swapped off, and the page is copied back into memory. Performances are awful, but at least it works.
Your question is rather broad, but a rule of thumb says that if you can process your data in batches, explicitely loading batches of data is much more efficient, but if the algorythm is too complex or requires actions on any data at any moment, just let the swap care for it.
So add a swap file of significantly greater than the memory you think you need (with the given sizes, I would try 100 or 200 Gbytes), start the processing before leaving office, and you could have results next day in the morning.</s>"

I am learning TensorFlow (as well as general deep learning). I am wondering when do we need to break the input training data into batches? And how do we determine the batch size? Is there a rule of thumb? Thanks!?,"Generally Deep Learning algorithms are ran on GPUs which has limited memory and thus a limited number of input data samples (in the algorithm commonly defined as batch size) could be loaded at a time.
In general larger batch size reduces the overall computation time (as the internal matrix multiplications are done in a parallel manner in GPU, thus with large batch sizes the time gets saved in reading/writing gradients and possibly some other operations output).
Another probable benefit of large batch size is: 
In multi-class classification problems, if the number of classes are large, a 
larger batch size makes algorithm generalize better(technically avoids over-fitting) over the different classes (while doing this a standard technique is to keep uniform distribution of classes in a batch).
While deciding batch size there are some other factors which comes into play are: learning rate and the type of Optimization method.

Are the extratree and randomforrest essentially the same? And xgboost uses boosting when it chooses the features for any particular tree i.e. sampling the features. But then how do the other two algorithms select the features?
Thanks!?","Extra-trees(ET) aka. extremely randomized trees is quite similar to random forest (RF). Both methods are bagging methods aggregating some fully grow decision trees. RF will only try to split by e.g. a third of features, but evaluate any possible break point within these features and pick the best. However, ET will only evaluate a random few break points and pick the best of these. ET can bootstrap samples to each tree or use all samples. RF must use bootstrap to work well.
xgboost is an implementation of gradient boosting and can work with decision trees, typical smaller trees. Each tree is trained to correct the residuals of previous trained trees. Gradient boosting can be more difficult to train, but can achieve a lower model bias than RF. For noisy data bagging is likely to be most promising. For low noise and complex data structures boosting is likely to be most promising.</s>"

For instance, if you want to take the weekday of an observation into account, you only use 6 (not 7) dummies assuming the one left out to be the base variable. When using one-hot encoding, your weekday variable is present as a categorical value in one single column, effectively having the regression use the first of its values as the base.</s>"

Non-realtime filters (e.g, where the full set of samples is provided to the filter, as for e.g. the scipy Savitsky-Golay filter) can pretend/simulate filtering at the ‘time’ of the current sample, but only by looking ahead at the full window.
Some might protest that this is demonstrably how e.g. the scipy Savitzky-Goay filter works, and that’s entirely correct, but nevertheless if you are asking about latency of a filter, which can only mean the delay that a real-time real-world filter will apply to real-time samples, the only possible answer is: this is only and undeniably/incontrovertibly determined by the window size.</s>"

The output of the transform is a complex -valued function of frequency. The term Fourier transform refers to both this complex-valued function and the mathematical operation.</s>"
What is parameter in statistics and probability?,Learning Objectives. Describe the sampling distribution for sample proportions and use it to identify unusual (and more common) sample results. Distinguish between a sample statistic and a population parameter.</s>
What does 1 minus r squared mean?,"R-Square (Rsq) is an important calculation used in linear regression for determining the strength of the relationship between two variables. Let's look at how Rsq is calculated, what it's actually measuring, and some helpful hints on how to do a regression analysis. Overview: What is Rsq?</s>"
What is the probability that the sample mean would differ from the population mean by more than?,"Figure 6.2.1: Distribution of a Population and a Sample Mean. Suppose we take samples of size 1, 5, 10, or 20 from a population that consists entirely of the numbers 0 and 1, half the population 0, half 1, so that the population mean is 0.5. The sampling distributions are: n = 1: ˉx 0 1 P(ˉx) 0.5 0.5. n = 5:</s>"
What are the problems of classification?,"In Machine Learning and Statistics, Classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (subpopulations), a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations and whose categories membership is known. What is Classification?</s>"
How do you analyze survival data?,"Survival analysis, also called time-to-event or event history analysis, is a long-standing approach to handling time to a particular event (s) or outcomes. 1 There are many examples of survival analysis as applied to cardiovascular nursing and health-related research questions. 2-4 Despite the common use of survival analysis, there are misconcep...</s>"
What is event clustering?,"eCDT: Event Clustering for Simultaneous Feature Detection and Tracking Abstract: Contrary to other standard cameras, event cam-eras interpret the world in an entirely different manner; as a collection of asynchronous events. Despite event camera's unique data output, many event feature detection and tracking algorithms have shown significant progress by making detours to frame-based data ...</s>"
How do you classify an image using Tensorflow?,"Image Classification (Recognition) Image recognition refers to the task of inputting an image into a neural network and having it output some kind of label for that image. The label that the network outputs will correspond to a predefined class. There can be multiple classes that the image can be labeled as, or just one.</s>"
Why does regression line go through mean?,"If there is no relationship between X and Y, the best guess for all values of X is the mean of Y. At any rate, the regression line always passes through the means of X and Y. This means that, regardless of the value of the slope, when X is at its mean, so is Y.</s>"
