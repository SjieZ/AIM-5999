"I was planning to teach np.einsum to colleagues, by hoping to show how it would be reduced to multiplications and summations.
So, instead of numerical data, I thought to use alphabet chars. in the arrays.
Say, we have A (2X2) as [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']] and B (2X1) as [['e'], ['f']]
We could use einsum to create a matrix C, say like: np.einsum('ab , bc -> ac', A, B). 
What I'd like to see is: it return the computation graph: something like: a*c + ..., etc.
Ofcourse, np.einsum expects numerical data and would give an error if given the above code to run.?","First, why do you need B to be 2-dim? Why not just np.einsum('ab , b -> a', A, B)?
Now the actual question:
It's not exactly what you want, but by using smart choices for A and B you can make this visible. e.g. A = [[1,10],[100,1000]] and B = [1,2], which gives np.einsum('ab , b -> a', A, B) = [21,2100] and it's quite obvious what has happend. 
More general versions are a little bit more complicated (but hopefully not necessary). The idea is to use different potences of primes (especially useful are 2 and 5, as they align to easy readyble number in dezimal system). In case you want to sum over more than one dimesion you might consider taking primes (2,3,5,7 etc) and then convert the result into another number system. 
In case you sume over two dims-> 30-ary system
3 dims (2,3,5,7)-> 210-ary system"

I trained a latent semantic indexing model, using gensim, on the wikipedia corpus. This lets me easily transform documents into the LSI topic distributions. My idea now is to represent users the same way. However, of course, users have a history of viewed articles, as well as ratings of articles.
So my question is: how to represent the users?
An idea I had is the following: represent a user as the aggregation of all the documents viewed. But how to take into account the rating?
Any ideas?
Thanks?","Clustering users makes sense. But if your only feature is the rating, I don't think it could produce a useful model for prediction. Below are my assumptions to make this justification:

The quality of movie should be distributed with a gaussion distribution.
If we look at the rating distribution of a common user, it should be something like gaussian.
I don't exclude the possibility that a few users only give ratings when they see a bad movie (thus all low ratings); and vice versa. But on a large scale of users, this should be unusual behavior. 

Thus I can imagine that after clustering, you get small groups of users in the two extreme cases; and most users are in the middle (because they share the gaussian-like rating behavior). Using this model, you probably get good results for users in the two small (extreme) groups; however for the majority of users, you cannot expect good predictions."

"I have a task to find similar parts based on numeric dimensions--diameters, thickness--and categorical dimensions--material, heat treatment, etc. I have a list of 1 million parts. My approach as a programmer is to put all parts on a list, pop off the first part and use it as a new ""cluster"" to compare the rest of the parts on the list based on the dimensions. As a part on the list matches the categorical dimensions and numerical dimensions--within 5 percent--I will add that part to the cluster and remove from the initial list. Once all parts in the list are compared with the initial cluster part's dimensions, I will pop the next part off the list and start again, populating clusters until no parts remain on the original list.

The key here is that m is much smaller than n.
How it works is that you train the network to recreate the input, exactly at the output. Then you cut the network into two halves. The front half goes from n to m dimensions (encoding the input into a smaller space). The back half goes from m dimensions to n dimensions (decoding, or ""reverse"" if you will).

"I built an image classifier using CNTK. The images are grayscale. Therefore, I entered the number of channels as 1. So, the model requires (1x64x64) data (64 being the image height and width).
The problem is, when I try to predict the class of a new image, it is seen as (64x64) only. So, the code errors out due to data mismatch.
Therefore, I reshaped the image using:
image_data = image_data.reshape((1, image_data.shape[0], image_data.shape[1]))
This generated (1x64x64) - which worked. Though the predictions are coming the same class for every image I select. I wonder if it is because of this reshaping or not. Can someone chime in? Thanks!?","Usually, with convolutional neural networks, differences in the image shape (the width/height of an image) will not matter. However, differences in the # of channels in the image (equivalently the depth of the image), will affect the performance. In fact, there will usually be dimension mismatch errors you get if the model was trained for greyscale/colour and you put in the other type."

"In the light of a project I've been playing with Python NLTK and Document Classification and the Naive Bayes classifier.  As I understand from the documentation, this works very well if your different documents are tagged with either pos or neg as a label (or more than 2 labels)
The documents I'm working with that are already classified don't have labels, but they have a score, a floating point between 0 and 5. 
What I would like to do is build a classifier, like the movies example in the documentation, but that would predict the score of a piece of text, rather than the label. I believe this is mentioned in the docs but never further explored as 'probabilities of numeric features'
I am not a language expert nor a statistician so if someone has an example of this lying around I would be most grateful if you would share this with me. Thanks!?","In general, different models have score methods that return different metrics. This is to allow classifiers to specify what scoring metric they think is most appropriate for them (thus, for example, a least-squares regression classifier would have a score method that returns something like the sum of squared errors). In the case of GaussianNB the docs say that its score method:

Returns the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels.

The accuracy_score method says its return value depends on the setting for the normalize parameter:

If False, return the number of correctly classified samples. Otherwise, return the fraction of correctly classified samples.

So it would appear to me that if you set normalize to True you'd get the same value as the GaussianNB.score method.
One easy way to confirm my guess is to build a classifier and call both score with normalize = True and accuracy_score and see if they match. Do they?"

Suggestions? How do I tell IDLE where to look for modules/packages installed via Anaconda? I feel like I'm missing something obvious but I can't find an answer on any previous Overflow questions.?","There is no need to remove your system Python. Anaconda sits alongside it. When it installs, it adds a line to your .bashrc that adds the Anaconda directory first in your PATH. This means that whenever you type python or ipython in the terminal, it will use the Anaconda Python (and the Anaconda Python will automatically use all the Anaconda Python libraries like numpy and scipy rather than the system ones). You should leave the system Python alone, as some system tools use it. The important points are:

Whichever Python is first on your PATH is what gets used when you use Python in the terminal. If you create a conda environment with conda and use source activate it will put that environment first on the PATH. 
Each Python (Anaconda or the system) will use its own libraries and not look at the others (this is not true if you set the PYTHONPATH environment variable, but I recommend that you don't)."

"I'm trying to reduce dimension of RGB images using PCA on python. But it seems to me that all codes I found only work on a greyscale image. Is there any way to do PCA on RGB image using any python library like sklearn or opencv?
Thanks?","The image is being opened as a color image, not as a black and white one. The shape is 181x187x3 because of that: the 3 is there because each pixel is an RGB value. Quite often images in black and white are actually stored in an RGB format. For an image image, if np.all(image[:,:,0]==image[:,:,1]) and so on, then you can just choose to use any of them (eg, image[:,:,0]). Alternatively, you could take the mean with np.mean(image,axis=2).
Note too that the range of values will depend on the format, and so depending upon what you mean by color intensity, you may need to normalize them. In the case of a jpeg, they are probably uint8s, so you may want image[:,:,0].astype('float')/255 or something similar."

Whereas DFS explores one branch at a time so when you reach your goal you can't be sure that there is not another path via another branch that is shorter.
So you should use BFS.
If your graph have different weights on its edges, then you should use Dijkstra's algorithm which is an adaptation of BFS for weighted graphs, but don't use it if you don't have weights.

"Scikit documentation states that:

Method for initialization:
‘k-means++’ : selects initial cluster centers for k-mean clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence. See section Notes in k_init for more details.

I tried to pass 10x6 dimension, in hope it would work, but it just throw up the error.?","Indeed, None adds a new dimension. You can also use tf.newaxis for this which is a bit more explicit IMHO. 
The new dimension is added in axis 1 because that's where it appears in the index. E.g. input[:, :, None] should result in shape (19, 4, 1, 64, 64, 3) and so on.
It might get clearer if we write all the dimensions in the slicing: input[:, None, :, :, :, :]. In slicing, : simply means taking all elements of the dimension. So by using one :, we take all elements of dimension 0 and then ""move on"" to dimension 1. Since None appears here, we know that the new size-1 axis should be in dimension 1. Accordingly, the remaining dimensions get ""pushed back""."

In my case i have (30,1,2080) and i want to reshape it to (15,)?","reshape() is able to change the shape only (i.e. the meta info), not the number of elements.
If the array has five elements, we may use e.g. reshape(5, ), reshape(1, 5),
reshape(1, 5, 1), but not reshape(2, 3).

reshape() in general don't modify data themselves, only meta info about them,

the .reshape() method (of ndarray) returns the reshaped array, keeping the original array untouched.



resize() is able to change both the shape and the number of elements, too.
So for an array with five elements we may use resize(5, 1), but also resize(2, 2) or resize(7, 9).

The .resize() method (of ndarray) returns None, changing only the original array (so it seems as an in-place change)."

"So I'm designing a matrix for a computer vision project and believe I have one of my calculations wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not sure where it's wrong. 
I was considering creating a matrix that was 100,000,000 x 100,000,000 with each 'cell' containing a single integer (1 or 0).  If my calculations are correct, it would take  9.53674316 × 10^9 MB. Is that correct?!?
My next question is, if it IS correct, are there ways to reduce memory requirements to a more realistic level while still keeping the matrix the same size?  Of course, there is a real possibility I won't actually need a matrix that size but this is absolute worse case scenario (as put forth by a friend).

What is the difference between Gini and entropy?,"Gini index and Node Entropy assist the binary classification tree to make decisions. Basically, the tree algorithm determines the feasible feature that is used to distribute data into the most genuine child nodes.
According to the Gini index, if we arbitrarily pick a pair of objects from a group, then they should be of identical class and the probability for this event should be 1.
The following are the steps to compute the Gini index:

Compute Gini for sub-nodes with the formula: The sum of the square of probability for success and failure (p^2 + q^2)
Compute Gini for split by weighted Gini rate of every node of the split

Now, Entropy is the degree of indecency that is given by the following:
Where a and b are the probabilities of success and failure of the node
When Entropy = 0, the node is homogenous
When Entropy is high, both groups are present at 50–50 percent in the node.
Finally, to determine the suitability of the node as a root node, the entropy should be very low."

"I have 45000 text records in my dataframe. I wanted to convert those 45000 records into word vectors so that I can train a classifier on the word vector. I am not tokenizing the sentences. I just split the each entry into list of words.

In the classifier model, I need all of those 45000 records, so that it can match 45000 output labels.?","If you are splitting each entry into a list of words, that's essentially 'tokenization'. 
Word2Vec just learns vectors for each word, not for each text example ('record') – so there's nothing to 'preserve', no vectors for the 45,000 records are ever created. But if there are 26,000 unique words among the records (after applying min_count), you will have 26,000 vectors at the end. 
Gensim's Doc2Vec (the '
Paragraph Vector' algorithm) can create a vector for each text example, so you may want to try that. 
If you only have word-vectors, one simplistic way to create a vector for a larger text is to just add all the individual word vectors together. Further options include choosing between using the unit-normed word-vectors or raw word-vectors of many magnitudes; whether to then unit-norm the sum; and whether to otherwise weight the words by any other importance factor (such as TF/IDF). 
Note that unless your documents are very long, this is a quite small training set for either Word2Vec or Doc2Vec."

Explain Branch Prediction in computer architectures.?,"Branch prediction is a technique used in modern processors to optimize instruction execution in the presence of conditional branches. Branches are instructions that can change the flow of program execution, and predicting the outcome of a branch before it is actually resolved can improve instruction fetch and execution efficiency. Techniques such as static branch prediction (based on instruction statistics), dynamic branch prediction (based on past execution behavior), and tournament branch prediction (combining multiple prediction techniques) are commonly used to reduce the performance impact of branches in pipelined processors."
"I already trained ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco with my custom data set on tensorflow. Also I trained YOLO with my data set too. I solved all problems and they work.
I encounter a problem with both models. When my data set includes images with more size than 400kb, the trained models do not work. Some times ""allocation of memory"" problem occurs. I solved them with changing parameters(batch size etc.). But I still don't know whether there is a limit of image size when we are preparing data set?
Why more than 400kb images are problem for my system? My question is not about pixel size,it's about image file size.
Thanks...

MapReduce, mapper does give entries from T sequentially. Before your mapper gets into map(), I.e in setup() put the block of code to read from the L and make it handy(use a feasible data structure to hold the list of data).

I can always re-write the problems to be solve in that way.?","This problem can be phrased as a zero-one assignment problem, and solved with a linear programming package, such as GLPK, which can handle integer programming problems. The problem is to find binary variables x[i] such that the sum of x[i]*w[i] is as large as possible, and less than the prescribed limit, where w[i] are the values which are added up. 
My advice is to use an existing package; combinatorial optimization algorithms are generally very complex. There is probably a Python interface for some package you can use; I don't know if GLPK has such an interface, but probably some package does."

"I'm looking for a simple solution using Python to store data as a flat file, such that each line is a string representation of an array that can be easily parsed.
I'm sure python has library for doing such a task easily but so far all the approaches I have found seemed like it would have been sloppy to get it to work and I'm sure there is a better approach. So far I've tried: 

the array.toFile() method but couldn't figure out how to get it to work with nested arrays of strings, it seemed geared towards integer data.
Lists and sets do not have a toFile method built in, so I would have had to parse and encode it manually. 
CSV seemed like a good approach but this would also require manually parsing it, and did not allow me to simply append new lines at the end - so any new calls the the CSVWriter would overwrite the file existing data.

The covariance matrix cov must be a (symmetric) positive semi-definite matrix. The determinant and inverse of cov are computed as the pseudo-determinant and pseudo-inverse, respectively, so that cov does not need to have full rank.?","Short answer
A positive semi-definite matrix does not have to have full rank, thus might not be invertible using the normal inverse.
Long answer
If cov does not have full rank, it does have some eigenvalues equal to zero and its inverse is not defined (because some of its eigenvalues would be infinitely large). Thus, in order to be able to invert a positive semi-definite covariance matrix (""semi"": not all eigenvalues are larger than zero), they use the pseudo-inverse. The latter inverts the non-zero eigenvalues and preserves the zero eigenvalues rather than inverting them to infinity.
The determinant of a matrix without full rank is zero. The pseudo-determinant only considers non-zero eigenvalues, yielding a non-zero result.
If, however, cov does have full rank, the results should be the same as with the usual inverse and determinant."

After deleting all packages and installing them only via pip, everything works fine. Thank you very much for the help!?","When you install Python packages using apt-get, you're relying on the distribution package manager.  The Ubuntu convention is to prefix Python 2 packages with python-, and Python 3 packages with python3-.
This distinction is necessary because Python 3 introduced some incompatible changes from Python 2.  It's thus not possible to simply recompile (most) packages for Python 3, meaning both need to be made available.
Alternatively, you can use the Python package manager, pip (or pip3).  The catch with this is that some packages (like scipy) require certain compiler toolchains which you might not have installed.
It's generally a good idea to stick to either apt-get or pip for a particular machine.  You probably won't have issues if you mix them, but it's better to be consistent."

For example, I might suggest [(X, Y), (Z, Q)] for $10, since [(X), (Y), (Z)] costs $11. Since these are prices, I can't use the greedy weighted set cover algorithm, because two people getting the same thing for different prices would be bad.
However, I haven't been able to find a paper (or anything) detailing an optimal algorithm for the weighted set cover problem. Can someone help with an implementation (I'm using Python), a paper, or even a high-level description of how it works?
The packages I have are in the hundreds, and the things are 5-6, so running time isn't really an issue.

In any case, running on Hadoop means running using Hadoop tools, whether it is Spark, Storm or other services that can run on Python, taking advantage of Hadoop means writing your algorithm for it.
if your algorithm is parallelizable, then likely you can easily take the piece that processes one piece of data and adapt it to run with Spark or Storm on huge datasets."

"This is my first time using Doc2Vec
I'm trying to classify works of an author. I have trained a model with Labeled Sentences (paragraphs, or strings of specified length), with words = the list of words in the paragraph, and tags = author's name. In my case I only have two authors.
I tried accessing the docvecs attribute from the trained model but it only contains two elements, corresponding to the two tags I have when I trained the model. I'm trying to get the doc2vec numpy representations of each paragraph I fed in to the training so I can use that as training data later on. How can I do this?
Thanks.?","Bulk training only creates vectors for tags you supplied. If you want to read out a bulk-trained vector per paragraph (as if by model.docvecs['paragraph000']), you have to give each paragraph a unique tag during training (like 'paragraph000'). You can give docs other tags as well - but bulk training only creates remembers doc-vectors for supplied tags. 
After training, you can infer vectors for any other texts you supply to infer_vector() - and of course you could supply the same paragraphs that were used during training."

"I'm wondering about how a dash app works in terms of loading data, parsing and doing initial calcs when serving to a client who logs onto the website.
For instance, my app initially loads a bunch of static local csv data, parses a bunch of dates and loads them into a few pandas data frames. This data is then displayed on a map for the client.
Does the app have to reload/parse all of this data every time a client logs onto the website? Or does the dash server load all the data only the first time it is instantiated and then just dish it out every time a client logs on?

I am not sure whether it is necessary because cv method already splits the data but I have seen some examples which split data beforehand. 
Thank you.?","This depends on what you specify in the cv parameter. 
If the independent variable is binary or multiclass it will use StratifiedKFold, else it will use KFold. You can also override the options by specifying a function (sklearn or otherwise) to perform the splits. 
The KFold function will divide the data into sequential folds. If you want it to do a random split, you can set the shuffle parameter to True. If you want to fix the random shuffle you can set a value for the random_state. If you do not, it will take a random value and the folds will be different every time you run the function.
For StratifiedKFold, it will split the data while attempting to keep the same ratio of classes of the dependent variable in each split. Because of this, there can be slight changes every time you call the function. i.e. It will not be sequential by default."

Best regards Søren Koch?","First of all, you have to know what exactly is your training sample. I am not sure what you mean by ""input"", does one input means one sample? Or does one row in your input means one sample?
If one input means one sample, you are in some trouble, because almost all CNN (and almost any other machine learning algos) requires consistency in the shape of the data. Given that some sample have more data than others, it might be a solution to crop out the extra ones from which have more data, or to just ignore those with less rows (so as to maximize the data you use). A more complicated way would be to run a PCA over some of the samples which have more rows (and same number of rows), then use only the principal components for all samples, if possible.
If one row means one sample, you can just merge all the data into a big chunk and process it the usual way. You got it."

"Assume you have lot of text sentences which may have (or not) similarities. Now you want to cluster similar sentences for finding centroids of each cluster. Which method is the prefered way for doing this kind of clustering? K-means with TF-IDF sounds promising. Nevertheless, are there more sophisticated algorithms or better ones? Data structure is tokenized and in a one-hot encoded format.?","You seem to be misunderstanding what the TF-IDF vectorization is doing. For each word (or N-gram), it assigns a weight to the word which is a function of both the frequency of the term (TF) and of its inverse frequency of the other terms in the document (IDF). It makes sense to use it for words (e.g. knowing how often  the word ""pizza"" comes up) or for N-grams (e.g. ""Cheese pizza"" for a 2-gram)
Now, if you do it on lines, what will happen? Unless you happen to have a corpus in which lines are repeated exactly (e.g. ""I need help in Python""), your TF-IDF transformation will be garbage, as each sentence will appear exactly once in the document. And if your sentences are indeed always similar to the punctuation mark, then for all intents and purposes they are not sentences in your corpus, but words. This is why there is no option to do TF-IDF with sentences: it makes zero practical or theoretical sense."

"Is there a better way to determine whether a variable in Pandas and/or NumPy is numeric or not ? 
I have a self defined dictionary with dtypes as keys and numeric / not as values.?","In short. No.
You see, dtypes is not a pandas controlled entity. Dtypes is typically a numpy thing.
Dtypes are not controllable in any way, they are automagically asserted by numpy and can only change when you change the data inside the dataframe or numpy array.
That being said, the typical reason for ending up with a float instead of an int as a dtype is because of the introduction of NaN values into the series or numpy array. This is a pandas gotcha some say. I personally would argue it is due to the (too) close coupling between pandas and numpy.
In general, dtypes should never be trusted for anything, they are incredibly unreliable. I think everyone working with numpy/pandas would live a better life if they were never exposed to dtypes at all.
If you really really hate floats, the only other option for you as far as I know is to use string representations, which of course causes even more problems in most cases."

"I recently came across Pytables and find it to be very cool. It is clear that they are superior to a csv format for very large data sets. I am running some simulations using python. The output is not so large, say 200 columns and 2000 rows. 
If someone has experience with both, can you suggest which format would be more convenient in the long run for such data sets that are not very large. Pytables has data manipulation capabilities and browsing of the data with Vitables, but the browser does not have as much functionality as, say Excel, which can be used for CSV. Similarly, do you find one better than the other for importing and exporting data, if working mainly in python? Is one more convenient in terms of file organization? Any comments on issues such as these would be helpful.
Thanks.?","If you want to do somewhat more selective fishing for particular rows, then the python csv module will allow you to read the csv file row by row into Python data structures. Consult the documentation.
This may be useful if just grabbing the first hundred lines reveals nothing about many of the columns because they are blank in all those rows. So you could easily write a program in Python to read as many rows as it takes to find and write out a few rows with non-blank data in particular columns. Likewise if you want to analyze a subset of the data matching particular criteria, you can read all the rows in and write only the interesting ones out for further analysis.
An alternative to csv is pandas. Bigger learning curve, but it is probably the right tool for analyzing big data. (1Gb is not very big these days)."

Is there an option to visualize this with graphviz?
If not, are there any other tools for this task (preferably with a python api).
Thank you.?","I don't think you can do this. Clusters are done via subgraphs, which are expected to be separate graphs, not overlapping with other subgraphs.
You could change the visualisation though; if you imagine that the members of a clique are members of some set S, then you could simply add a node S and add directed or dashed edges linking each member to the S node. If the S nodes are given a different shape, then it should be clear which nodes are in which cliques.
If you really want, you can give the edges connecting members to their clique node high weights, which should bring them close together on the graph.
Note that there would never be edges between the clique nodes; that would indicate that two cliques are maximally connected, which just implies they are in fact one large clique, not two separate ones."

Is the softmax loss the same as the cross entropy loss?,"What hassan has suggested is not correct - 
Categorical Cross-Entropy loss or Softmax Loss is a Softmax activation plus a Cross-Entropy loss. If we use this loss, we will train a CNN to output a probability over the C classes for each image. It is used for multi-class classification.
What you want is multi-label classification, so you will use Binary Cross-Entropy Loss or Sigmoid Cross-Entropy loss. It is a Sigmoid activation plus a Cross-Entropy loss. Unlike Softmax loss it is independent for each vector component (class), meaning that the loss computed for every CNN output vector component is not affected by other component values. That’s why it is used for multi-label classification, where the insight of an element belonging to a certain class should not influence the decision for another class.
Now for handling class imbalance, you can use weighted Sigmoid Cross-Entropy loss. So you will penalize for wrong prediction based on the number/ratio of positive examples."

"I'm solving a classification problem with sklearn's logistic regression in python.
My problem is a general/generic one.  I have a dataset with two classes/result (positive/negative or 1/0), but the set is highly unbalanced.  There are ~5% positives and ~95% negatives.
I know there are a number of ways to deal with an unbalanced problem like this, but have not found a good explanation of how to implement properly using the sklearn package.
What I've done thus far is to build a balanced training set by selecting entries with a positive outcome and an equal number of randomly selected negative entries.  I can then train the model to this set, but I'm stuck with how to modify the model to then work on the original unbalanced population/set.
What are the specific steps to do this?  I've poured over the sklearn documentation and examples and haven't found a good explanation.?","First of all, two features is a really small amount. Neural Networks are highly non-linear models with a really really high amount of freedom degrees, thus if you try to train a network with more than just a couple of networks it will overfit even with balanced classes. You can find more suitable models for a small dimensionality like Support Vector Machines in scikit-learn library.
Now about unbalanced data, the most common techniques are Undersampling and Oversampling. Undersampling is basically training your model several times with a fraction of the dataset, that contains the non dominant class and a random sample of the dominant so that the ratio is acceptable, where as oversampling consist on generating artificial data to balance the classes. In most cases undersampling works better.
Also when working with unbalanced data it's quite important to choose the right metric based on what is more important for the problem (is minimizing false positives more important than false negatives, etc)."

"Background:
My program currently assembles arrays in Python. These arrays are connected to a front-end UI and as such have interactive elements (i.e. user specified values in array elements). These arrays are then saved to .txt files (depending on their later use). The user must then leave the Python program and run a separate Fortran script which simulates a system based on the Python output files. While this only takes a couple of minutes at most, I would ideally like to automate the process without having to leave my Python UI. 

Assemble Arrays (Python) -> Edit Arrays (Python) -> Export to File (Python)
-> Import File (Fortran) -> Run Simulation (Fortran) -> Export Results to File (Fortran)
-> Import File to UI, Display Graph (Python)

Is this possible? What are my options for automating this process? Can I completely remove the repeated export/import of files altogether?

Thanks?","Sparse matrices are matrices that contain mostly zero elements, where only a small fraction of the elements are non-zero. Sparse matrices are common in many real-world applications, such as network analysis, image processing, and recommendation systems. Storing and manipulating sparse matrices efficiently requires specialized algorithms that take advantage of their sparsity. Common techniques include compressed sparse row (CSR) format, compressed sparse column (CSC) format, and coordinate list (COO) format. These formats store only the non-zero elements and their indices, which can greatly reduce the memory and computational requirements for sparse matrix operations."

What are eigenvalues of a matrix?,"OK, you only need one matrix and randomness isn't important. Here's a way to construct a matrix according to your description. Start with an identity matrix 50 by 50. Assign 10 to the first (upper left) element. Assign a small number (I don't know what's appropriate for your problem, maybe 0.1? 0.01? It's up to you) to all the other elements. Now take that matrix and square it (i.e. compute transpose(X) . X where X is your matrix). Presto! You've squared the eigenvalues so now you have a covariance matrix. 
If the small element is small enough, X is already positive definite. But squaring guarantees it (assuming there are no zero eigenvalues, which you can verify by computing the determinant -- if the determinant is nonzero then there are no zero eigenvalues).

"i have a chart pattern recognition program using neural networks written in python .instead of porting the whole code to C# ,i decided it was better to only send certain bits indicating the following :
Buy=1,Sell=-1,Do nothing=0
once they are in C-sharp ,i could relay them to a third party program (multicharts) which would continuously call the C# dll function and receive these values after a certain time interval .
my question is ,is there a way to relay these bit's to C# and pack all of this in a dll ,which gets read by the 3rd party program ?
the whole reason i want to port to C# is because multicharts only reads in dll's and i dont think python has them.

My original problem was that I have a list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], and I want to select every chunk of size x with gap of one. So if I want to select select every other chunk of size 2, the outcome would be [1,2,4,5,7,8]. A chunk size of three would give me [1,2,3,5,6,7].
I've searched a lot on slicing and I couldn't find a way to select chunks instead of element. Make multiple slice operations then join and sort seems a little too expensive. The input can either be a python list or numpy ndarray. Thanks in advance.?","A possible solution is to think of your number set as n chunks of item, each chunk having the length of m. If you randomly select for each chunk exactly one item from each lists, then you will never hit dead ends. Just make sure that the first item in each chunk (except the first chunk) will be of different list than the last element of the previous chunk.
You can also iteratively randomize numbers, always making sure you pick from a different list than the previous number, but then you can hit some dead ends.
Finally, another possible solution is to randomize a number on each position sequentially, but only from those which ""can be put there"", that is, if you put a number, none of the constraints will be violated, that is, you will have at least a possible solution."

I have these two column to determine previous data previous_key (column that corresponds to run_dt) and creat_ts (time when we load the data)
I found two approaches so far but they don't work in efficient way:

Use sql DELETE command – might be slow, eventually requires Vacuum the table to reclaim storage space and resort rows
Unload the data from a table into a file on S3 and then load table back (truncate and insert) with max clndr_key filtered out. Not really good either, might be risky.

Please suggest any good approach to rerun jobs on Redshift cluster.
Note: partitions functionality is not available.?","Deleting data stored in Redshift with DELETE command will take time. The reason is that you are doing a soft delete, I mean you mark existing rows as deleted and then insert new row representing updated form of the data.
So one way is executing DELETE for junks of data. Instead of deleting one by one you should try to address multiple rows. Since each write takes place in 1 MB chunks of data, we should be minimizing those data read and writes eventually. 
If you have a good information about the topology of the data stored in Redshift compute nodes and slices, addition to that information about distribution key and sort key, you can separate your DELETE command into multiple statements.

"I have please two questions concerning the ImageDataGenerator:
1) Are the same augmentations used on the whole batch or each image gets its own random transformation?
e.g. for rotation, does the module rotates all the images in the batch with same angle or each image get a random rotation angle ?
2) The data in ImageDataGenerator.flow is looped over (in batches) indefinitely. Is there a way to stop this infinite loop, i.e. doing the augmentation only for n number of time. Because I need to modify the batch_size in each step (not each epoch).
Thanks?","Rotation matrix. In linear algebra, a rotation matrix is a transformation matrix that is used to perform a rotation in Euclidean space.

"I am quite new with pandas (couple of months) and I am starting building up a project that will be based on a pandas data array.
Such pandas data array will consist on a table including different kind of words present in a collection of texts (around 100k docs, and around 200 key-words). 
imagine for instance the words ""car"" and the word ""motorbike"" and documents numbered doc1, doc2 etc.
how should I go about the arrangement? 
a) The name of every column is the doc number and the index the words ""car"" and ""motorbike"" or 
b) the other way around; the index being the docs numbers and the columns head the words?
I don't have enough insights of pandas in order to be able to foreseen what will the consequences of such choice. And all the code will be based on that decision.
As a side note there array is not static, there will be more documents and more words being added to the array every now and again.
what would you recommend? a or b? and why?
thanks.?","As you mention in the comments you don't know the size of the words/tweets matrix that you will eventually obtain, so that makes using an array a cumbersome solution.
It feels more natural to use a dictionary here, for the reasons you noted.
The keys of the dictionary will be the words in the tweets, and the values can be lists with (tweet_id, term_frequency) elements.
Eventually you might want to do something else (e.g. classification) with your term frequencies. I suspect this is why you want to use a numpy array from the start.
It should not be too hard to convert the dictionary to a numpy array afterwards though, if that is what you wish to do. 
However note that this array is likely to be both very big (1M * number of words) and very sparse, which means it will contain mostly zeros. 
Because this numpy array will take a lot of memory to store a lot of zeros, you might want to look at a data structure that is more memory efficient to store sparse matrix (see scipy.sparse).
Hope this helps."

(Python or Julia solutions would be ideal but other languages like R or MATLAB are similar enough to understand the approach.)?","The question is asked in general terms, so the following is also in general terms.  I hope this contributes something to helping you with your specific problem.
One approach would be a variant of cross validation.  You randomly select some portion of the data, and evaluate the result on a second portion of the data. Repeat the entire process until you satisfy your convergence criteria or exhaust your count.  The convergence criteria might be something like getting the same or similar network at some rate.  You can do this in either of two modes, allowing or not allowing reuse of the data.
A second point to keep in mind is that your execution time depends on the length of your ""feature vectors"" or whatever serves that function in your application.  Selecting the important components of your feature vectors, both reduces the processing time and also can help the training be more successful. Scikit learn has a function SelectKBest() that may be helpful for this."

Is there any noticeable loss of performance when using the high-level interface?
For example when dealing with a file with many variables inside, and we must read just one of them.?","The basic procedure is this:
1. Open the input file
This can be accomplished with the basic builtin open function.
2.  Open the output file
You'll probably use the same method that you chose in step #1, but you'll need to open the file in write mode.
3. Read the input file to a variable
It's often preferable to read the file one line at a time, and operate on that one line before reading the next, but if memory is not a concern, you can also read the entire thing into a variable all at once.
4.  Choose selected lines
There will be any number of ways to do this, depending on how you did step #3, and your requirements.  You could use filter, or a list comprehension, or a for loop with an if statement, etc.  The best way depends on the particular constraints of your goal.
5.  Write the selected lines

Again, according to the help, there is no MaxIterations argument but you can define the tolerance in f (ftol) that is the function you want to minimize or x (xtol) the solution, before exiting the code.
You can also use scipy.optimize.minimize(). In it, you can define a maxiter argument which will be in the options dictionary.

How do you handle collinearity in regression?,"My assumption here is that you're asking this question because in cases of linear modeling, highly collinear variables can cause issues.
The short answer is no, you don't need to remove highly correlated variables from clustering for collinearity concerns.  Clustering doesn't rely on linear assumptions, and so collinearity wouldn't cause issues.
That doesn't mean that using a bunch of highly correlated variables is a good thing.  Your features may be overly redundant and you may be using more data than you need to reach the same patterns.  With your data size/feature set that's probably not an issue, but for large data you could leverage the correlated variables via PCA/dimensionality reduction to reduce your computation overhead."

"Currently, I am trying to implement a basic logistic regression algorithm in Python to differentiate between A vs. B.
For my training and test data, I have ~50,000 samples of A vs. 1000 samples of B. Is this a problem if I use half the data of each to train the algorithm and the other half as testing data (25000 train A, 500 train B and so on for testing accuracy).
If so, how can I overcome this problem. Should I consider resampling, doing some other ""fancy stuff"".?","The method fit of the model train the model for one pass through the data you gave it, however because of the limitations in memory (especially GPU memory), we can't train on a big number of samples at once, so we need to divide this data into small piece called mini-batches (or just batchs). The methode fit of keras models will do this data dividing for you and pass through all the data you gave it.
However, sometimes we need more complicated training procedure we want for example to randomly select new samples to put in the batch buffer each epoch (e.g. GAN training and Siamese CNNs training ...), in this cases we don't use the fancy an simple fit method but instead we use the train_on_batch method. To use this methode we generate a batch of inputs and a batch of outputs(labels) in each iteration and pass it to this method and it will train the model on the whole samples in the batch at once and gives us the loss and other metrics calculated with respect to the batch samples."

"I am trying to use scipy.optimize.least_squares(fun= my_fun, jac=my_jac, max_nfev= 1000) with two callable functions: my_fun and my_jac
both fuctions: my_fun and my_jac, use an external software to evaluate their value, this task is much time consuming, therefore I prefer to control the number of evaluations for both
the trf method uses the my_fun function for evaluating if trust region is adequate and the my_jac function for determine both the cost function and the jacobian matrix
There is an input parameter max_nfev. does this parameter count only for the fun evaluations? does it consider also the jac evaluations?
moreover, in matlab there are two parameters for the lsqnonlin function, MaxIterations  and MaxFunctionEvaluations. does it exist in scipy.optimize.least_squares? 
Thanks
Alon?","According to the help of scipy.optimize.least_squares, max_nfev is the number of function evaluations before the program exits :

max_nfev : None or int, optional
      Maximum number of function evaluations before the termination.
      If None (default), the value is chosen automatically:

Again, according to the help, there is no MaxIterations argument but you can define the tolerance in f (ftol) that is the function you want to minimize or x (xtol) the solution, before exiting the code.
You can also use scipy.optimize.minimize(). In it, you can define a maxiter argument which will be in the options dictionary.
If you do so, beware that the function you want to minimize must be your cost function, meaning that you will have to code your least square function.
I hope it will be clear and useful to you"

"I'm trying to do object recognition in an embedded environment, and for this I'm using Raspberry Pi (Specifically version 2).

So far I've tried different approaches:

I tried different keypoint extraction and description algorithms: SIFT, SURF, ORB. SIFT and SURF are too heavy and ORB is not so good.
Then I tried using different algorithms for keypoint extraction and then description. The first approach was to use FAST algorithm to extract key points and then ORB or SURF for description, the results were not good and not rotation invariant, then i tried mixing the others.

I now am to the point where I get the best results time permitting using ORB for keypoint extraction and SURF for description. But it is still really slow.
